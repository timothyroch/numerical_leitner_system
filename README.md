## 📖 General Information
Welcome to the **Study App** – a simple, effective learning tool based on the **Leitner System** with 4 boxes. This app helps you learn and retain information using spaced repetition, a proven technique for long-term memory retention.

### 🗂️ The 4-Box System Breakdown:
- **Box 1**: Daily Review – New cards or cards answered incorrectly.
- **Box 2**: Every 3 Days – Cards answered correctly once.
- **Box 3**: Every 7 Days – Cards answered correctly twice.
- **Box 4**: Every 14 Days – Cards mastered and reviewed periodically.

## 🚀 Features
- **Create Flashcards:** Add flashcards easily for any topic.
- **Automated Leitner System:** Cards automatically move through the boxes based on your performance.
- **Progress Tracking:** View your study progress and see how many cards are in each box.
- **Simple & Clean Interface:** No distractions – just efficient learning.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Create Flashcards:**
    - Open the app and go to the "Flashcards" section.
    - Add a new flashcard with a question and answer.

2. **Study Sessions:**
    - Start a study session, and the app will show cards from the appropriate box.
    - Answer each question to the best of your ability.

3. **Card Movement Rules:**
    - If you answer correctly: The card moves to the next box.
    - If you answer incorrectly: The card goes back to Box 1.

4. **Consistent Review:**

    - 6 cards move to Box 2, and 4 cards stay in Box 1.
- **Day 4:** You review the 6 cards from Box 2 and get 5 correct and 1 incorrect.
    - 5 cards move to Box 3, and 1 card goes back to Box 1.
- **Day 11:** The 5 cards in Box 3 are reviewed. You get 3 correct and 2 wrong.
    - 3 cards move to Box 4, and 2 return to Box 1.

## ⚠️ Tips for Effective Studying
